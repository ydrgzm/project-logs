[Coding] - 1304 Refined the logic for handling rows with multiple duplicate IDs by implementing an exclusion mechanism. The update ensures that rows containing multiple duplicate IDs are properly excluded from processing, and their count is accurately tracked and reported to improve user decision making (1.83)
[Coding] - 1304 Updated the fetch_record_ids endpoint to apply mapping logic only when no duplicate IDs are detected. This ensures that mapping is performed only on unique records, improving processing efficiency and preventing re-applying in handle-duplicate endpoint. (1.25)
[Coding] - 1304 Updated the file naming convention across job-related outputs to use the format '%b%d-%H%M%S' (e.g., Apr22-1530), ensuring more readable and timestamped filenames that aid in version tracking and easier identification of generated files. (1.08)
[Coding] - 1304 Replaced hardcoded file naming logic with the use of JobMessages.FETCHED_RECORD_IDS_FILENAME.value for the record IDs file name.

[Coding] - Fixed issue of dtype difference and is_deleted filter Taiga#1179. Identified the issue of data type between the values in source file and values from Salesforce. The values from Salesforce were in string and had scientific notation values so handled that too. Obtained type of field from Salesforce to avoid wrapping of values in qoutes as the values will be treated as string but Salesforce can expect double.e.g. AnnualRevenue. (5.83)"
